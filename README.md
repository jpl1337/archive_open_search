# ArchiveOpenSearch
## Ingest National Archive documents and make them searchable.
(WORK IN PROGRESS)

ArchiveOpenSearch is a self-hosted service that ingests and processes National Archive documentsâ€”converting them into searchable, structured data accessible through a fast and intuitive search interface.

Our goal is to unlock the knowledge hidden in archived records by overcoming the barrier of manual reading, empowering researchers, students, and the curious to search our historical archives effortlessly.

Inspired by the [2025 release of John F. Kennedy Assassination Records](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/release-2025).
